All codes are in the same file. It works, but maybe not easy to read.

In the future, I will seperate them into individual modules. Also, the file path need to be adjusted.

In order to reduce the file size, the drug associated target file is in .txt document. When using, it should be saved in .csv.

Package Version:

Numpy: 1.20.1;
